#Trello like app

This is an upcoming [Trello](https://trello.com) like app developed with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com). This project is also my Bachelors Degree project since I have to develop a web and have played a bit with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), i chose to use it to make this.

##Roadmap

On my roadmap I have:
* A login system, preferably with [Facebook](http://facebook.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com) or [Github](http://github.com).
* Personalized lists.
* Sub-lists.
* Collaboration.
* Chat with online friends.

##Deadline
I intend to have a minimum viable product by the end of December 2014. The final version have to be ready in June 2015 for the presentation.
